In AshOS, there are several keywords:
- Vanilla: we try to be as close to the "vanilla" version of respective distribution that is being installed.
- Minimalism: we adhere to a lego build system. Start small and build as complex a system as you would like. The main focus of development is on having a solid minimal profile, based on which user can have infinite immutable permutations!
